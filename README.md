# 4.3BSD-Quasijarus
Unofficial 4.3BSD-Quasijarus repository to easily track changes from 0 through to 0c

This is intended to provide easy access to the source from the original 4.3BSD Quasijarus 0, 0a, 0b and 0c releases, and to provide a base for any patches if desired.

For each release
* src.tar.Z and syssrc.tar.Z have been extracted into . and ./sys respectively
* files.txt contains the files and timestamps from the two tarfiles
* If the release had a setup.txt and qjchanges.txt they have been copied in
* The commit message is the original release notes
* An appropriate tag has been created
