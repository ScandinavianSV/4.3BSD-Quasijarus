.SH NAME
wait \- await completion of process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wait
.SH DESCRIPTION

system call must be executed in the parent process,

the Shell itself executes
.I wait,
without creating a new process.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
sh(1)
.SH BUGS
Not all the processes of a 3- or more-stage
D 2
pipeline are children of the Shell, and
thus can't be waited for.

I 2
pipeline are children of the Shell, and thus can't be waited for.
