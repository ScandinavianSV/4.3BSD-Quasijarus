.SH NAME
mjd2weekday \- find day-of-week from MJD
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
int mjd2weekday(mjd)
long mjd;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mjd2weekday
takes a Modified Julian Day number
and returns the corresponding day of the week.
.PP
The \fImjd\fP argument is signed; \fImjd2weekday\fP returns
the correct day of the week for every possible signed 32-bit input value,
which is a range of many millions of years.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.I Mjd2weekday
returns one of 7 possible integer values
denoting days of the week as follows:
.PP
.nf
.RS
.DT
0 = Sunday
1 = Monday
2 = Tuesday
3 = Wednesday
4 = Thursday
5 = Friday
6 = Saturday
.RE
.fi
.SH NOTES
MJD 0 (Gregorian 1858-11-17)
was a Wednesday, not a Sunday, hence \fImjd2weekday\fP is not the same
as \fImjd\fP % 7.
.PP
The implementation of \fImjd2weekday\fP consists of a few bit shifts
and table look-ups, and involves no division operation.
It is expected to be much more efficient than using the modulo (\fB%\fP)
operator.
