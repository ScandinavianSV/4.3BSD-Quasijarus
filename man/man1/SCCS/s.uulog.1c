.B \-u
.I user
]
.SH DESCRIPTION

and
.IR uux (1C)
transactions in the file
.B /usr/spool/uucp/\s-1LOGFILE.\s0
.PP
The options command

.TP 8
.BI \-s sys\^
Print information about work involving system
.IR sys .
.TP 8
.BI \-u user\^

.IR user .
.SH FILES
/usr/spool/uucp/\s-1LOGFILE\s0
.SH SEE ALSO
uucp(1C), uux(1C).
.SH NOTES
Very early releases of \s-1UUCP\s0 used separate log files
for each of the \s-1UUCP\s0 utilities;
.I uulog
was used to merge the individual logs into a master file.
This capability has not been necessary for some time and is
no longer supported.
.SH BUGS
\s-1UUCP\s0's recording of which user issued a request is unreliable.
.PP
.I Uulog
is little more than an overspecialized version of
.IR grep (1).
