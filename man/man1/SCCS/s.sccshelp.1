.sh SYNOPSIS
D 2
.bd help
E 2
I 2
.bd sccshelp
E 2
[arg]~...
.sh DESCRIPTION
D 2
.it Help
finds information to explain a message from a command or explain the use of
a command.
E 2
I 2
.it Sccshelp
finds information to explain a message from an SCCS command or explain the use
of a command.
E 2
Zero or more arguments may be supplied.
If no arguments are given,
D 2
.it help
E 2
I 2
.it sccshelp
E 2
will prompt for one.
.s1
The arguments may be either
message numbers (which normally appear in parentheses following messages)
or command names,
of one of the following types:
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~1	Begins with non-numerics, ends in numerics.
The non-numeric prefix is usually an abbreviation for the program or
set of routines which produced the message
(e.g., ``ge6'', for message 6 from the
.it get
command).
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~2	Does not contain numerics (as a command, such as
.it get
)
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~3	Is all numeric (e.g., ``212'')
.i0
.s1
The response of the program will be the explanatory information related
to the argument, if there is any.
.s1
D 2
When all else fails, try ``help stuck''.
E 2
I 2
When all else fails, try ``sccshelp stuck''.
E 2
.sh FILES
The ASCII file searched for the explanatory information
for each type of argument is as follows:
.s1
.lp +20 10
.if n type~1	/usr/lib/help/``prefix-of-argument''
.if t type~1	/usr/lib/help/\fIprefix-of-argument\fR
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~2	/usr/lib/help/cmds
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~3	/usr/lib/sccs.hf
.i0
.s1
If the file to be searched for either a type 1 or a type 2
argument does not exist, the search will be attempted on the
file for the type 3 argument.
In no case, however, will more than one file be searched per argument.
.s1
Anyone wishing to modify the files should list out portions
of them \*- the format will be obvious.
