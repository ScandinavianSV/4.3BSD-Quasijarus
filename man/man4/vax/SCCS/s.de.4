.SH NAME
de \- DEC DEUNA 10 Mb/s Ethernet interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "device de0 at uba0 csr 174510 vector deintr"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I de
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through
a Digital Equipment UNIBUS Network Adapter (DEUNA).
.PP
D 2
The host's Internet address is specified at boot time with an SIOCSIFADDR
E 2
I 2
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an SIOCSIFADDR
E 2
ioctl.  The
.I de
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.IR arp (4P)
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.PP
The interface normally tries to use a ``trailer'' encapsulation
D 2
to minimize copying data on input and output.  This may be
disabled, on a per-interface basis, by setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS
E 2
I 2
to minimize copying data on input and output.
The use of trailers is negotiated with ARP.
This negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis,
by setting the IFF_NOTRAILERS
E 2
flag with an SIOCSIFFLAGS ioctl.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\fBde%d: hardware address %s\fP.
This is a normal autoconfiguration message noting the 6 byte physical
ethernet address of the adapter.
.PP
\fBde%d: oerror, flags=%b tdrerr=%b (len=%d)\fP.
The hardware indicated an error
in transmitting a packet to the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.PP
\fBde%d: ierror, flags=%b lenerr=%b (len=%d)\fP.
The hardware indicated an error
in reading a packet from the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.PP
\fBde%d: can't handle af%d\fP.  The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.
.PP
\fBde%d: buffer unavailable\fP.  The interface received more packets
than it had buffers allocated to receive them.
.PP
\fBde%d: address change failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b\fP.
The interface was unable to reprogram
its physical ethernet address.
This may happen with very early models of the interface.
This facility is used only when
the controller is not the first network interface configured for XNS.
.PP
The following messages indicate a probable hardware error performing
the indicated operation during autoconfiguration or initialization.
The two control and status registers
should indicate the nature of the failure.
See the hardware manual for details.
.PP
\fBde%d: reset failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b\fP.
.PP
\fBde%d: ppcb failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b\fP.
.PP
\fBde%d: read addr failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b\fP.
.PP
\fBde%d: wtring failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b\fP.
.PP
\fBde%d: wtmode failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b\fP.
