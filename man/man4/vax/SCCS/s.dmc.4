.SH NAME
dmc \- DEC DMC-11/DMR-11 point-to-point communications device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "device dmc0 at uba0 csr 167600 vector dmcrint dmcxint"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I dmc
interface provides access to a point-to-point communications
device which runs at either 1 Mb/s or 56 Kb/s.  DMC-11's communicate
using the DEC DDCMP link layer protocol.
.PP
The
.I dmc
interface driver also supports a DEC DMR-11 providing point-to-point
communication running at data rates from 2.4 Kb/s to 1 Mb/s.
DMR-11's are a more recent design and thus are preferred over DMC-11's.

The NXMT and NRCV constants in the driver should be increased in this case,

I 5
The NXMT and NRCV constants in the driver may be increased in this case,
E 5
as the DMR can accept up to 64 transmit and receive buffers, as opposed
to 7 for the DMC.

Several device error counters are available via "adb", for
more information see the adb script /usr/lib/adb/dmcstats, or the
DMC11 technical manual.

The host's address must be specified with an SIOCSIFADDR ioctl,
and the destination address specified with a SIOCSIFDSTADDR ioctl,

.SH ROUTING
The driver places a HOST entry in the kernel routing tables for the
address given in the SIOCSIFDSTADDR ioctl.  To use the DMC as a
D 3
link between localnets, you must explicitly add the route with
the route(8) command.
E 3
I 3
link between local nets, the route to the remote net must be added manually
with the
.IR route (8)
command, or by the use of the routing process
.IR routed (8)
on each end of the link.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.BR "dmc%d: bad control %o" .
A bad parameter was passed to the
.I dmcload
routine.
.PP
.BR "dmc%d: unknown address type %d" .
An input packet was received which contained a type of
address unknown to the driver.

.SH BUGS
The current version of the driver uses a link-level encapsulation
so that multiple protocol types may be used.
It is thus incompatible with earlier drivers,
including the 4.2BSD version.
E 3
D 2
.SH BUGS
Should allow multiple outstanding DMA requests, but due to
the design of the current UNIBUS support routines this is
very difficult.
