This device is capable of producing high quality
text;
this paper is an example of
.UL troff
output.
.PP
The phototypesetter itself normally runs with four fonts,
containing roman, italic and bold letters 
(as on this page),
a full greek alphabet, and a substantial number of
special characters and mathematical symbols.
Characters can be printed in a range of sizes,
and placed anywhere on the page.
.PP
.UL troff
allows the user full control over fonts,
sizes, and character positions,
as well as the usual features of a formatter _
right-margin justification, automatic hyphenation,
page titling and numbering, and so on.
It also provides macros, arithmetic variables and operations,
and conditional testing, for complicated formatting tasks.
.PP
This document is an introduction to the most basic use of
.UL troff .
It presents just enough information to enable the user
to do simple formatting
tasks like making viewgraphs,
and to make incremental changes to existing packages
of
.UL troff
commands.
In most respects, the 
.UC UNIX
formatter
.UL nroff

is identical to
.UL troff ,
so this document also serves as a tutorial on
.UL nroff .

[\fIEditor's note:\fP
This document has been formatted with
.UL pstroff
like the rest of the book, but has not been edited in content.
There have been significant improvements made to
.UL troff
since this document was written, most noticeably
the PostScript version called
.UL pstroff .
See [1] for details.
