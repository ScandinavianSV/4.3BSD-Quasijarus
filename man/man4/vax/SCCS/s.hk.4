.SH DESCRIPTION
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0;
minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, etc.
The standard device names begin with ``hk'' followed by
the drive number and then a letter a-h for partitions 0-7 respectively.
The character ? stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.
.PP

The origin and size of the pseudo-disks on each drive are
as follows:
E 2
I 2
The block files access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.  There is also a `raw' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files
conventionally begin with an extra `r.'

On a dual RK-07 system
partition hk?a is used
for the root for one drive
and partition hk?g for the /usr file system.
If large jobs are to be run using
hk?b on both drives as swap area provides a 10Mbyte paging area.
Otherwise
partition hk?c on the other drive
is used as a single large file system.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

D 2
error occured during transfer of the specified sector of the specified
E 2
I 2
error occurred during transfer of the specified sector of the specified
E 2
disk partition.  The contents of the cs2, ds and er registers are printed
E 5
I 5
\fBhk%d%c: hard error %sing fsbn %d[-%d] cs2=%b ds=%b er=%b\fR.
An unrecoverable error occurred during transfer of the specified
filesystem block number(s),
which are logical block numbers on the indicated partition.
The contents of the cs2, ds and er registers are printed
E 5
in octal and symbolically with bits decoded.
The error was either unrecoverable, or a large number of retry attempts
(including offset positioning and drive recalibration) could not
recover the error.
.PP
\fBrk%d: write locked\fR.  The write protect switch was set on the drive
when a write was attempted.  The write operation is not recoverable.
.PP
\fBrk%d: not ready\fR.  The drive was spun down or off line when it was
accessed.  The i/o operation is not recoverable.
.PP
\fBrk%d: not ready (came back!)\fR.  The drive was not ready, but after
printing the message about being not ready (which takes a fraction
of a second) was ready.  The operation is recovered if no further
errors occur.
.PP
D 5
\fBrk%d%c: soft ecc sn%d\fR.  A recoverable ECC error occurred on the
D 2
specified sector of the specified disk partition.  This happens normally

\fBup%d%c: soft ecc reading fsbn %d[-%d]\fP.
A recoverable ECC error occurred on the
specified sector(s) in the specified disk partition. 
E 5
This happens normally
E 2
a few times a week.  If it happens more frequently than
D 2
this the sectors where the errors are occuring should be checked to see
E 2
I 2
this the sectors where the errors are occurring should be checked to see
E 2
if certain cylinders on the pack, spots on the carriage of the drive
or heads are indicated.
.PP
\fBhk%d: lost interrupt\fR.  A timer watching the controller detected
no interrupt for an extended period while an operation was outstanding.
This indicates a hardware or software failure.  There is currently a
hardware/software problem with spinning down drives while they are
being accessed which causes this error to occur.
The error causes a UNIBUS reset, and retry of the pending operations.
If the controller continues to lose interrupts, this error will recur
a few seconds later.
.SH BUGS
In raw I/O
.I read
and
.IR write (2)
truncate file offsets to 512-byte block boundaries,
and
.I write
scribbles on the tail of incomplete blocks.
Thus,
in programs that are likely to access raw devices,
.I read, write
and
.IR lseek (2)
should always deal in 512-byte multiples.
.PP
DEC-standard error logging should be supported.
.PP
A program to analyze the logged error information (even in its
present reduced form) is needed.
.PP
The partition tables for the file systems should be read off of each
pack, as they are never quite what any single installation would prefer,
and this would make packs more portable.

.PP
The rk07 g partition size in rk.c disagrees with that in /etc/disktab.
