.SH NAME
mul64 \- multiply two 64-bit integers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B long long mul64(m1, m2)
.B long long m1, m2;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This helper function is being defined in preparation for adding 64-bit integer
arithmetic support to the 4.3BSD-Quasijarus C programming environment.
The plan is to make the standard C compiler implement
.I "long long"
and
.I "unsigned long long"
data types representing signed and unsigned 64-bit integers, respectively,
and implement all standard C arithmetic operators on these types.
.PP
It is expected that the operation of multiplying two 64-bit multiplicands
to yield a 64-bit product (the standard \fB*\fP operator applied to
.I "long long"
types)
will be implemented by calling a helper function.
.I Mul64
defined here is that helper function.
.PP
Because the bit width of the product is equal to that of the multiplicands,
the function is the same whether the input and output values are viewed
as signed or unsigned.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The least significant half of the product is returned in register R0
and the most significant half is returned in register R1 on the VAX.
This arrangement matches what is natural for the VAX architecture
and will be the standard convention for functions returning
.IR "long long" .
