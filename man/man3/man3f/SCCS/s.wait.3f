.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wait
causes its caller to be suspended until a signal is received or one of
its child processes terminates.
If any child has terminated since the last

return is immediate; if there are no children, return is immediate
with an error code.

If the returned value is positive, it is the process ID of the child and
