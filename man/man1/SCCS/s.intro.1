.SH DESCRIPTION
D 2
This section describes publicly accessible commands
in alphabetic order.
E 2
I 2
This section describes publicly accessible commands in alphabetic order.
E 2
Certain distinctions of purpose are made in the headings:
.TP
(1)
Commands of general utility.
.TP
(1C)
Commands for communication with other systems.
.TP
(1G)
Commands used primarily for graphics and computer-aided design.
.PP
D 2
N.B.: Commands related to system maintenance, which appeared in
section 1, distinguished by (1M), in previous versions of the manual
have been moved to section 8, as they are of little interest to most
users.
.PP
The word `VAX-11' at the foot of a page means that some or all
of the description applies only to the implementation for the
Digital Equipment Corporation VAX-11.
Pages added or changed between the distribution of UNIX/32V and the
Berkeley Distribution indicate `3rd Berkeley Distribution' or
`4th Berkeley Distribution' at the lower left, as appropriate.
E 2
I 2
N.B.: Commands related to system maintenance used to appear in
section 1 manual pages and were distinguished by (1M) at the top of the
page.  These manual pages now appear in section 8.

in the Introduction.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Upon termination each command returns two bytes of status,
one supplied by the system giving the cause for
termination, and (in the case of `normal' termination)
D 2
one supplied by the program,
see
E 2
I 2
one supplied by the program, see
E 2
.I wait
and
.IR exit (2).
The former byte is 0 for normal termination, the latter
is customarily 0 for successful execution, nonzero
to indicate troubles such as erroneous parameters, bad or inaccessible data,
or other inability to cope with the task at hand.
It is called variously `exit code', `exit status' or
D 2
`return code', and is described only where special
conventions are involved.
E 2
I 2
`return code', and is described only where special conventions are involved.
