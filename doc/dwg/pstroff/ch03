.Ch "Chapter 3" "Extended troff compatibility and special fonts"
.PP
Some historical troff document sources, particularly those that
describe the troff toolchain itself, exercise the old troff character
set to the max, including those characters which just happen to lack
exact counterparts in the standard Adobe fonts.
However, being able to format those old documents and render all of
those troublesome characters has been one of the design goals for
this version of troff, therefore,
a number of special fonts have been created which make
these additional characters available.
This chapter lists the special fonts and the characters
they provide.
.PP
The special fonts listed in this chapter can be used in two ways:
one can either add the fonts of interest to the font list (\fB\-f\fP
option, see \(sc2.2) on an individual basis, or one can use the \fB\-T\fP
option described below.
Either way, the \*(PS output from each troff session that uses
any of the special fonts must be run through one of the finishing
tools described in Chapter\ 5.
This requirement is clearly a deficiency in the present implementation,
but we are stuck with it for now: the ``font set merging'' code in the
\fIpstmerge\fP and \fIpstfinish\fP tools (see Chapter\ 5) is where some of the
``black magic'' of special fonts is implemented.
.\"
.Sc "3.1" "Extended ligature fonts"
.PP
While Adobe unfortunately chose to exclude the \f(Lb\(ff\fP,
\f(Lb\(Fi\fP and \f(Lb\(Fl\fP ligatures from their standard Roman font
character set, they do include these ligatures in their so-called
expert fonts.
The latter are \fInot\fP directly usable as regular text fonts:
they don't contain any of the ordinary uppercase or lowercase letters,
and have very few characters in common with the regular text fonts in general.
Instead, their intended use is to supplement the regular text fonts:
for example, if one uses Adobe Garamond Regular to set some text,
that text can be enriched with some extra characters from
Adobe Garamond Regular Expert.
The ``expert'' characters are small capitals, old-style figures,
and some other special characters we aren't concerned with
at this point, as there is no precedent of their use in any
historical \s-1UNIX\s0 troff version.
.PP
But what makes these expert fonts interesting for us
is that they do contain all 5 f-ligatures.
For example, their renditions in the Adobe Garamond family of
expert fonts look like this:
.TS
center;
l10 cfLr cfLr cfLr cfLr cfLr
l10 cfLi cfLi cfLi cfLi cfLi
l10 cfLb cfLb cfLb cfLb cfLb.
Regular	V	W	X	Y	Z
Italic	V	W	X	Y	Z
Bold	V	W	X	Y	Z
.TE
.PP
I have picked Adobe Garamond because back in 2004, when I wrote
the first version of \fIpstroff\fP and made the first crude attempt
at emulating the old C/A/T character set, these were the only
expert fonts I knew \(em and I knew them only thanks to a mention
in the \*(PL, 2nd ed., Appendix\ E: Standard Character Sets
and Encoding Vectors.
Not having access to a pirate copy,
I had bought the ``Adobe Garamond Expert Volume'' from fonts.com,
and immediately liberated it via my FTP site, so that no one else
ever has to pay for it.
Then a year later the International Free Computing Task Force
received a liberated copy of what appears to be the complete
\fIAdobe Type Library\fP as of somewhere around 1992, and
that one contains some more expert fonts.
However, we (the IFCTF) do not currently have any expert fonts
which are designed to match the standard Times family,
and I don't even know for certain whether or not such expert fonts exist.
.PP
To make the long story short, I've adopted the Adobe Garamond Expert
fonts for the purpose of ``illustrating'' the f-ligatures, i.e.,
for exhibiting them in documents like this one.
Furthermore, as the next section explains, the \fIpstroff\fP suite
includes a set of special Type\ 3 fonts which extend the standard
Times fonts with these not-perfectly-matching ligatures
originating from Adobe Garamond.
In order to facilitate both functions,
it was deemed desirable to create a set of
very small ``expert subset'' fonts, based on Adobe Garamond Expert,
but reduced to just the 6 characters of interest: the 5 f-ligatures
and \&\fCthreequartersemdash\fP.
These Troff5lig fonts, as they've been named,
are included in the \fIpstroff\fP distribution:
.TS
center box;
c s s || cfI s
c|c|c||c|c
l|a|n||l|n.
Troff5lig font	Based on
_
\*(PS name	\*(Tr name	Bytes	Adobe font	Bytes
_
Troff5lig-Regular	Lr	8999	AGaramondExp-Regular	80980
Troff5lig-Italic	Li	9214	AGaramondExp-Italic	49355
Troff5lig-Bold	Lb	9332	AGaramondExp-Bold	47015
.TE
.PP
Each of these Troff5lig fonts has been created by taking the original
expert font from Adobe, cracking it open (stripping both \fBeexec\fP
and charstring encryption, then disassembling the charstrings), removing
all character definitions except the tiny subset of interest to us,
removing those subroutines which became unused as a result,
renumbering the remaining subroutines to compact the \fBSubrs\fP array,
and reassembling the result into a valid \*(PS font.
Each font thus provides a total of 6 characters, each mapped
at two alternate code points:
.TS
center box;
cfBI | c    | c    | c    | c  s  | c  s
^    | ^    | ^    | ^    | c  s  | c  s
^    | ^    | ^    | ^    | cI|cI | cI|cI
lfC  | cfLr | cfLi | cfLb | n | cB | n | aB.

ffi	Y	Y	Y	89	Y	29	\e(Fi
ffl	Z	Z	Z	90	Z	30	\e(Fl
threequartersemdash	\&=	\&=	\&=	61	\&=	136	\e(em
.TE
.PP
Whichever code points one chooses to use, if one wishes to use any
of these Troff5lig fonts directly, without going through the Type\ 3
fonts described in the next section, one needs to do two things:
.IP 1.
Explicitly add Lr, Li and/or Lb to the font list \(em see \(sc2.2;
.IP 2.
Invoke the requisite special font explicitly to produce the desired
character: for example, to produce \f(LbY\fP, one needs to enter
\fB\ef(LbY\efP\fP or \fB\ef(Lb\e(Fi\efP\fP.
.\"
.Sc "3.2" "TroffEmu font set"
.PP
The method of invoking special characters explicitly
from the Lr/Li/Lb fonts works only for new documents such as this one.
Getting the present version of troff to produce a nice-looking
and semantically correct rendition of the original \*(Mn without ``cheating''
requires a different technique, which is the subject of this section.
.PP
Let us recall from \(sc1.3.5 that there are 8 characters in the
historical troff character set which have no counterparts in the
``standard'' Adobe font set of
{Times-Roman, Times-Italic, Times-Bold, Symbol}:
\fB\e(sq\fP, \fB\e(ff\fP, \fB\e(Fi\fP, \fB\e(Fl\fP,
\fB\e(rh\fP, \fB\e(lh\fP, \fB\e(bs\fP and \fB\e(ci\fP.
The first 4 of these were base font characters in the original C/A/T troff,
the remaining 4 were Special Font characters.
.PP
The present version of troff allows one to regain the 4 missing
base font characters by using a set of special ``base'' text fonts
which implement the 4 characters in question, in addition
to the standard Roman character set defined by Adobe.
Specifically, the compiled-in table of \fB\e(\fIxx\fR named characters
maps the foursome to base font code points in an otherwise-unused range,
and the TroffEncoding vector in turn maps them to \*(PS character names
as follows:
.TS
center box;
cfBI | cfI | cfR
cfBI | cfI | cfR
cfB | cfB | afC .
Named	Compiled-in	TroffEncoding
Character	table mapping	maps to
_
\e(ff	\eX1C	ff
\e(Fi	\eX1D	ffi
\e(Fl	\eX1E	ffl
\e(sq	\eX1F	square
.TE
.PP
None of the \*(PS character names in the right column of the above table
appear in any of the standard text fonts from Adobe, thus in normal usage
all occurrences of \fB\e(\fIxx\fR characters in the left column
will be caught and blocked by the mechanism of \(sc2.4.3.
However, the provision is made for adding the 4 characters in question
to a standard text font by assigning them the listed PS character names.
.PP
So where does one get a set of standard text fonts
(i.e., versions of Times-Roman, Times-Italic and Times-Bold)
that have the 4 extra characters in each?
In the opinion of this author, the best solution would be to create
a set of custom Type\ 1 fonts.
Disassembling (``cracking'') the standard Times fonts, adding a few
characters and reassembling the result back into a valid Type\ 1 font
would not be difficult at all from the technical standpoint,
but I found it to be a task beyond my own skills in terms of the
artistic design issues.
The square character would obviously be trivial, but the 3 missing
f-ligatures are not: drawing them in such a way that would match
the rest of the font (the basic `f', `i' and `l' letterforms,
as well as the existing fi and fl ligatures) properly and perfectly
is a task that calls for a professional font designer.
.PP
Unless we find someone who is in love with the original troff
to the point of being willing to put up some cash to hire a professional
font designer to create a set of Type\ 1 fonts which would capture
the letter shapes of the historical C/A/T or APS-5 version of the
Times family, including the full set of f-ligatures, we make do
by pulling in the 3 missing ligatures from a not-perfectly-matching
font: currently, it is the Troff5lig subset of the Adobe Garamond
Expert family.
.PP
I have considered the approach of extracting the \&\fCff\fP,
\&\fCffi\fP and \&\fCffl\fP charstrings from the AGaramondExp fonts
and adding them, along with the necessary subroutines, to disassembled
Times fonts.
However, I've been discouraged from doing so by the differences
in the font-wide hints and other differences between the fonts
to be mixed in that manner.
Therefore, as early as my first \fIpstroff\fP effort back in 2004
I had settled on the Type\ 3 kludge which is still in use in the
present version with only minor changes.
.PP
The present kludge is a set of Type\ 3 fonts, called the TroffEmu fonts,
which implement almost every character by invoking the \fBshow\fP
operator recursively to draw that character from another underlying font.
The 3 TroffEmu fonts included in the \fIpstroff\fP distribution
are structured as follows:
.TS
center box;
c|c|c
a|a|a.
TroffEmu font	Pulls regular chars from	Pulls {\fCff\fP,\fCffi\fP,\fCffl\fP} from

TroffEmu-Times-Italic	Times-Italic	Troff5lig-Italic
TroffEmu-Times-Bold	Times-Bold	Troff5lig-Bold
.TE
.LP
Each of these 3 fonts implements the full TroffEncoding
character set as follows:
.IP \(bu
All ``regular'' characters, i.e., those not mentioned specifically below,
are drawn from the underlying standard Times family font.
.IP \(bu
The 3 extended ligature characters \&\fCff\fP, \&\fCffi\fP and \&\fCffl\fP
are drawn from the associated Troff5lig font.
Note, however, that the basic \fBfi\fP and \fBfl\fP ligatures
are drawn from the Times family font, \fInot\fP from Troff5lig.
.IP \(bu
The \&\fCemdash\fP (\fB\e(em\fP) character is drawn as a \(34 em dash glyph
(the \&\fCthreequartersemdash\fP character from the appropriate Troff5lig
font) centered within a spacing width of 1 em, like it was drawn
in the olden days.
.IP \(bu
The \&\fCsquare\fP (\fB\e(sq\fP) character is drawn directly
by the TroffEmu fonts themselves.

.Sc "3.2.1" "\e(sq character implementation"

My choice to make the square hollow in \fBR\fP and \fBI\fP,
but filled in \fBB\fP is based on my belief that such an arrangement
was in effect Back In The Day in the original Bell Labs troff world.
That belief, in turn, is based on the following supporting evidence:
