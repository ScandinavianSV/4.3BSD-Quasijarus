not necessarily be directly possible.)
.PP
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0;
minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, etc.
The standard device names begin with ``up'' followed by
the drive number and then a letter a-h for partitions 0-7 respectively.
The character ? stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.
.PP
I 2
The block files access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.  There is also a `raw' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files
conventionally begin with an extra `r.'
.PP
In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk sector).
Likewise
.I seek
calls should specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
.SH "DISK SUPPORT"
The driver interrogates the controller's holding register
to determine the type of drive attached.  The driver recognizes
D 4
four different drives: AMPEX 9300, CDC 9766, AMPEX Capricorn,
and FUJITSU 160.
E 4
I 4
seven different drives:
CDC 9762, CDC 9766,
AMPEX DM980, AMPEX 9300, AMPEX Capricorn,
FUJITSU 160, and FUJITSU Eagle
(the Eagle is not supported by the SC-21).

It is unwise for all of these files to be present in one installation,
since there is overlap in addresses and protection becomes
a sticky matter.
The up?a partition is normally used for the root file system,
the up?b partition as a paging area,
and the up?c partition for pack-pack copying (it maps the entire disk).

On 160M drives the up?h partition maps the rest of the pack.

An unrecoverable error occurred during transfer of the specified
filesystem block number(s),
which are logical block numbers on the indicated partition.
E 5
The contents of the cs2, er1 and er2 registers are printed

in octal and symbolically with bits decoded.
The error was either unrecoverable, or a large number of retry attempts
(including offset positioning and drive recalibration) could not
recover the error.

\fBup%d: write locked\fR.  The write protect switch was set on the drive
when a write was attempted.  The write operation is not recoverable.

accessed.  The i/o operation is not recoverable.

.PP
\fBsc%d: lost interrupt\fR.  A timer watching the controller detecting
no interrupt for an extended period while an operation was outstanding.
This indicates a hardware or software failure.  There is currently a
hardware/software problem with spinning down drives while they are
being accessed which causes this error to occur.
The error causes a UNIBUS reset, and retry of the pending operations.
If the controller continues to lose interrupts, this error will recur
a few seconds later.
.SH BUGS
In raw I/O
.I read
and
.IR write (2)
truncate file offsets to 512-byte block boundaries,
and
.I write
scribbles on the tail of incomplete blocks.
Thus,
in programs that are likely to access raw devices,
.I read, write
and
.IR lseek (2)
should always deal in 512-byte multiples.
D 4
.PP
D 2
DEC-standard error logging and bad block forwarding should be supported;
the code to do this could be easily incorporated from the
.IR hp (4)
driver.  All that would be needed then would be a stand-alone formatting
program to detect the bad sectors, format the disk so that the sectors
were marked bad and initialize the bad sector files.
E 2
I 2
DEC-standard error logging should be supported.
E 4
E 2
.PP
A program to analyze the logged error information (even in its
present reduced form) is needed.
.PP
The partition tables for the file systems should be read off of each
pack, as they are never quite what any single installation would prefer,
and this would make packs more portable.
