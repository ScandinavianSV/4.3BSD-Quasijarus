/etc/termcap
.SH DESCRIPTION
D 5
.I Termcap
E 5
I 5
.I Termcap\^
E 5
is a data base describing terminals,
used,
.IR e.g. ,
by
D 5
.IR vi (1)
E 5
I 5
.IR vi\^ (1)
E 5
and

Terminals are described in
D 5
.I termcap
by giving a set of capabilities which they have, and by describing
E 5
I 5
.I termcap\^
by giving a set of capabilities that they have and by describing
E 5
how operations are performed.
Padding requirements and initialization sequences
are included in
D 5
.I termcap.

Entries in
D 5
.I termcap
consist of a number of `:' separated fields.
The first entry for each terminal gives the names which are known for the
terminal, separated by `|' characters.  The first name is always 2 characters
long and is used by older version 6 systems which store the terminal type
in a 16 bit word in a systemwide data base.
The second name given is the most common abbreviation for the terminal, and the
last name given should be a long name fully identifying the terminal.
The second name should contain no blanks; the last name may well contain
blanks for readability.

consist of a number of `:'-separated fields.
The first entry for each terminal gives the names that are known for the
terminal, separated by `|' characters.
The first name is always two characters
long and is used by older systems which store the terminal type
in a 16-bit word in a system-wide data base.
The second name given is the most common abbreviation for the terminal,
the last name given should be a long name fully identifying the terminal,
and all others are understood as synonyms for the terminal name.
All names but the first and last
should be in lower case and contain no blanks;
the last name may well contain
upper case and blanks for readability.
.PP
Terminal names (except for the last, verbose entry)
should be chosen using the following conventions.
The particular piece of hardware making up the terminal
should have a root name chosen, thus \*(lqhp2621\*(rq.
This name should not contain hyphens.
Modes that the hardware can be in
or user preferences
should be indicated by appending a hyphen and an indicator of the mode.
Therefore, a \*(lqvt100\*(rq in 132-column mode would be \*(lqvt100-w\*(rq.
The following suffixes should be used where possible:
.sp
.ev
.ta
.ta \w'\fBSuffix\fP\ \ \ 'u +\w'With automatic margins (usually default)\ \ 'u
.nf
.if t \{\
.nr Xx \n(.lu-\n(.i-\w'\fBSuffix\fP\ \ \ With automatic margins (usually default)\ \ vt100-am'u
.in +\n(Xxu/2u
.\}
\fBSuffix	Meaning	Example\fP
-w	Wide mode (more than 80 columns)	vt100-w
-am	With automatic margins (usually default)	vt100-am
-nam	Without automatic margins	vt100-nam
-\fIn\fP	Number of lines on the screen	aaa-60
-na	No arrow keys (leave them in local)	concept100-na
-\fIn\^\fPp	Number of pages of memory	concept100-4p
-rv	Reverse video	concept100-rv

equivalents,
since they were considered useless,
or are subsumed by other capabilities.
New software should not rely on them at all.

Capabilities in

terminal operations.

All capabilities have two letter codes.  For instance, the fact that
the Concept has \*(lqautomatic margins\*(rq (i.e. an automatic return and linefeed
when the end of a line is reached) is indicated by the capability \fBam\fR.

which indicate particular features that the terminal has;
numeric capabilities,
giving the size of the display or the size of other attributes;
and string capabilities,
which give character sequences that can be used to perform particular
terminal operations.
All capabilities have two-letter codes.
For instance, the fact that
the Concept has
.I automatic margins
.RI ( i.e. ,
an automatic return and linefeed
when the end of a line is reached) is indicated by the Boolean capability

Numeric capabilities are followed by the character `#' then the value.
In the example above
.BR co ,

Finally, string valued capabilities, such as \fBce\fR (clear to end of line
sequence) are given by the two character code, an `=', and then a string
ending at the next following `:'.  A delay in milliseconds may appear after
the `=' in such a capability, and padding characters are supplied by the
editor after the remainder of the string is sent to provide this delay.
The delay can be either a integer, e.g. `20', or an integer followed by
an `*', i.e. `3*'.  A `*' indicates that the padding required is proportional
E 5
I 5
Finally, string-valued capabilities, such as
.B ce
(clear-to-end-of-line
sequence) are given by the two-letter code, an `=', then a string
ending at the next following `:'.
A delay in milliseconds may appear after
the `=' in such a capability,
which causes padding characters to be supplied by
.I tputs\^
after the remainder of the string is sent to provide this delay.
The delay can be either a number,
.I e.g.
`20', or a number followed by
an `*',
.IR i.e. ,
`3*'.
An `*' indicates that the padding required is proportional
E 5
to the number of lines affected by the operation, and the amount given is
D 5
the per-affected-unit padding required.
When a `*' is specified, it is sometimes useful to give a delay of the form
`3.5' specify a delay per unit to tenths of milliseconds.

(In the case of insert-character,
the factor is still the number of

When an `*' is specified, it is sometimes useful to give a delay of the form
`3.5' to specify a delay per line to tenths of milliseconds.

A number of escape sequences are provided in the string valued capabilities
for easy encoding of characters there.  A \fB\eE\fR maps to an \s-2ESCAPE\s0
character, \fB^x\fR maps to a control-x for any appropriate x, and the sequences
\fB\en \er \et \eb \ef\fR give a newline, return, tab, backspace and formfeed.
Finally, characters may be given as three octal digits after a \fB\e\fR,
and the characters \fB^\fR and \fB\e\fR may be given as \fB\e^\fR and \fB\e\e\fR.
If it is necessary to place a \fB:\fR in a capability it must be escaped in
octal as \fB\e072\fR.
If it is necessary to place a null character in a string capability it
must be encoded as \fB\e200\fR.  The routines which deal with
.I termcap
use C strings, and strip the high bits of the output very late so that
a \fB\e200\fR comes out as a \fB\e000\fR would.

.B Preparing Descriptions
.PP
We now outline how to prepare descriptions of terminals.
The most effective way to prepare a terminal description is by imitating
the description of a similar terminal in
D 5
.I termcap
E 5
I 5
.I termcap\^
E 5
and to build up a description gradually, using partial descriptions
with
D 5
.I ex
E 5
I 5
.I vi\^
E 5
to check that they are correct.
Be aware that a very unusual terminal may expose deficiencies in
the ability of the
D 5
.I termcap
E 5
I 5
.I termcap\^
E 5
file to describe it
or bugs in
D 5
.I ex.
E 5
I 5
.IR vi\^ .
E 5
D 7
To easily test a new terminal description you can set the environment variable
D 5
TERMCAP to a pathname of a file containing the description you are working
on and the editor will look there rather than in
.I /etc/termcap.
TERMCAP can also be set to the termcap entry itself
to avoid reading the file when starting up the editor.
(This only works on version 7 systems.)
E 5
I 5
.B
.SM TERMCAP
to the absolute pathname of a file containing the description you are working
on and programs will look there rather than in
E 7
I 7
To easily test a new terminal description you are working on
you can put it in your home directory in a file called
.I .termcap\^
and programs will look there before looking in
E 7
.IR /etc/termcap\^ .
I 7
You can also set the environment variable
E 7
.B
I 7
.SM TERMPATH
to a list of absolute file pathnames (separated by spaces or colons),
one of which contains the description you are working on,
and programs will search them in the order listed, and nowhere else.
See
.IR termcap\^ (3X).

To get the padding for insert-line right
(if the terminal manufacturer did not document it),
a severe test is to use
.I vi\^
to edit
.I /etc/passwd\^
at 9600 baud, delete roughly 16 lines from the middle of the screen,
then hit the `u' key several times quickly.
If the display messes up, more padding is usually needed.
A similar test can be used for insert-character.

The number of columns on each line for the terminal is given by the
\fBco\fR numeric capability.  If the terminal is a \s-2CRT\s0, then the
number of lines on the screen is given by the \fBli\fR capability.
If the terminal wraps around to the beginning of the next line when
it reaches the right margin, then it should have the \fBam\fR capability.
If the terminal can clear its screen, then this is given by the
\fBcl\fR string capability.  If the terminal can backspace, then it
should have the \fBbs\fR capability, unless a backspace is accomplished
by a character other than \fB^H\fR (ugh) in which case you should give
this character as the \fBbc\fR string capability.  If it overstrikes
(rather than clearing a position when a character is struck over)
then it should have the \fBos\fR capability.
E 5
I 5
.B Basic Capabilities
E 5
.PP
I 5
The number of columns on each line of the display is given by the
.B co
numeric capability.
If the display is a \s-1CRT\s0, then the
number of lines on the screen is given by the
.B li
capability.
If the display wraps around to the beginning of the next line when
the cursor reaches the right margin, then it should have the
.B am
capability.
If the terminal can clear its screen,
the code to do this is given by the
.B cl
string capability.
If the terminal overstrikes
(rather than clearing the position when a character is overwritten),
it should have the
.B os
capability.
If the terminal is a printing terminal,
with no soft copy unit,
give it both
.B hc
and
.BR os .
.RB ( os
applies to storage scope terminals,
such as the Tektronix 4010 series,
as well as to hard copy and
.SM APL
terminals.)
If there is a code to move the cursor to the left edge of the current row,
give this as
.BR cr .
(Normally this will be carriage-return,
.BR ^M .)
If there is a code to produce an audible signal (bell, beep,
.IR etc.\^ ),
give this as
.BR bl .
.PP
If there is a code (such as backspace)
to move the cursor one position to the left,
that capability should be given as
.BR le .
Similarly,
codes to move to the right, up, and down
should be given as
.BR nd ,
.BR up ,
and
.BR do ,
respectively.
These
.I local cursor motions\^
should not alter the text they pass over;
for example, you would not normally use
\*(lqnd=\ \*(rq
unless the terminal has the
.B os
capability,
because the space would erase the character moved over.
.PP
E 5
A very important point here is that the local cursor motions encoded
in
D 5
.I termcap
are undefined at the left and top edges of a \s-2CRT\s0 terminal.
The editor will never attempt to backspace around the left edge, nor
will it attempt to go up locally off the top.  The editor assumes that
feeding off the bottom of the screen will cause the screen to scroll up,
and the \fBam\fR capability tells whether the cursor sticks at the right
edge of the screen.  If the terminal has switch selectable automatic margins,
E 5
I 5
.I termcap\^
have undefined behavior at the left and top edges of a
.SM CRT
display.
Programs should never attempt to backspace around the left edge,
unless
.B bw
is given, and never attempt to go up off the top
using local cursor motions.
.PP
In order to scroll text up,
a program goes to the bottom left corner of the screen and sends the
.B sf
(index) string.
To scroll text down,
a program goes to the top left corner of the screen and sends the
.B sr
(reverse index) string.
The strings
.B sf
and
.B sr
have undefined behavior
when not on their respective corners of the screen.
Parameterized versions of the scrolling sequences are
.B SF
and
.BR SR ,
which have the same semantics as
.B sf
and
.B sr
except that they take one parameter
and scroll that many lines.
They also have undefined behavior
except at the appropriate corner of the screen.
.PP
The
.B am
capability tells whether the cursor sticks at the right
edge of the screen when text is output there,
but this does not necessarily apply to
.B nd
from the last column.
Leftward local motion is defined from the left edge only when
.B bw
is given; then an
.B le
from the left edge will move to the right edge of the previous row.
This is useful for drawing a box around the edge of the screen,
for example.
If the terminal has switch-selectable automatic margins,
E 5
the
D 5
.I termcap
file usually assumes that this is on, i.e. \fBam\fR.
E 5
I 5
.I termcap\^
description usually assumes that this feature is on,
.IR i.e. ,
.BR am .
If the terminal has a command
that moves to the first column of the next line,
that command can be given as
.B nw
(newline).
It is permissible for this to clear the remainder of the current line,
so if the terminal has no correctly-working \s-2CR\s0 and \s-2LF\s0
it may still be possible to craft a working
.B nw
out of one or both of them.
E 5

These capabilities suffice to describe hardcopy and \*(lqglass-tty\*(rq terminals.

Consider the HP2645, which, to get to row 3 and column 12, needs
to be sent \eE&a12c03Y padded for 6 milliseconds.  Note that the order

preceded by a \fB^T\fR, with the row and column simply encoded in binary,

If the terminal has a settable scrolling region
(like the VT100),
the command to set this can be described with the

which takes two parameters: the top and bottom lines of the scrolling region.
The cursor position is, alas, undefined after using this command.
It is possible to get the effect of insert or delete line
using this command \(em the
.B sc

Inserting lines at the top or bottom of the screen can also be done using

Other terminals, such as the Concept\-100 and the Perkin Elmer Owl, make

either eliminated, or expanded to two untyped blanks.  You can find out
which kind of terminal you have by clearing the screen and then typing
text separated by cursor motions.  Type \*(lqabc\ \ \ \ def\*(rq using local

You can determine
the kind of terminal you have by clearing the screen then typing
text separated by cursor motions.
Type \*(lqabc\ \ \ \ def\*(rq using local
E 5
cursor motions (not spaces) between the \*(lqabc\*(rq and the \*(lqdef\*(rq.
Then position the cursor before the \*(lqabc\*(rq and put the terminal in insert
D 5
mode.  If typing characters causes the rest of the line to shift
E 5
I 5
mode.
If typing characters causes the rest of the line to shift
E 5
rigidly and characters to fall off the end, then your terminal does
D 5
not distinguish between blanks and untyped positions.  If the \*(lqabc\*(rq

If the \*(lqabc\*(rq

shifts over to the \*(lqdef\*(rq which then move together around the end of the
D 5
current line and onto the next as you insert, you have the second type of
terminal, and should give the capability \fBin\fR, which stands for
\*(lqinsert null\*(rq.  If your terminal does something different and unusual
then you may have to modify the editor to get it to use the insert
mode your terminal defines.  We have seen no terminals which have an insert

The editor can handle both terminals which have an insert mode, and terminals
which send a simple sequence to open a blank position on the current line.
Give as \fBim\fR the sequence to get into insert mode, or give it an
empty value if your terminal uses a sequence to insert a blank position.
Give as \fBei\fR the sequence to leave insert mode (give this, with
an empty value also if you gave \fBim\fR so).
Now give as \fBic\fR any sequence needed to be sent just before sending
the character to be inserted.  Most terminals with a true insert mode
will not give \fBic\fR, terminals which send a sequence to open a screen
position should give it here.  (Insert mode is preferable to the sequence
to open a position on the screen if your terminal has both.)
If post insert padding is needed, give this as a number of milliseconds
in \fBip\fR (a string option).  Any other sequence which may need to be
sent after an insert of a single character may also be given in \fBip\fR.

Now give as
.B ic
any sequence that needs to be sent just before
each character to be inserted.
Most terminals with a true insert mode
will not give
.BR ic ;
terminals that use a sequence to open a screen
position should give it here.
(If your terminal has both,
insert mode is usually preferable to
.BR ic .
Do not give both unless the terminal actually requires both to be used
in combination.)
If post-insert padding is needed, give this as a number of milliseconds
in
.B ip
(a string option).
Any other sequence that may need to be
sent after insertion of a single character can also be given in
.BR ip .
If your terminal needs to be placed into an `insert mode'
and needs a special code preceding each inserted character,
then both
.BR im / ei
and
.B ic
can be given, and both will be used.
The

It is occasionally necessary to move around while in insert mode
D 5
to delete characters on the same line (e.g. if there is a tab after
the insertion position).  If your terminal allows motion while in
insert mode you can give the capability \fBmi\fR to speed up inserting

You should choose one display form as

This arises, for example, from terminals like the Concept with more than
one page of memory.
If the terminal has only memory-relative cursor addressing and not
screen-relative cursor addressing,
a screen-sized window must be fixed into
the display for cursor addressing to work properly.
This is also used for the Tektronix 4025, where
.B ti

.IR termcap\^ .
.PP
Other capabilities
include
.BR is ,
an initialization string for the terminal,
and
.BR if ,
the name of a file containing long initialization strings.
These strings are expected to set the terminal into modes
consistent with the rest of the
.I termcap\^
description.
They are normally sent to the terminal by the
.I tset\^
program each time the user logs in.
They will be printed in the following order:
.BR is ;
setting tabs using
.B ct
and
.BR st ;
and finally
.BR if .
.RI ( Terminfo\^
uses
.B i1-i2
instead of
.B is
and runs the program
.B iP
and prints
.B i3
after the other initializations.)
A pair of sequences that does a harder reset from a totally unknown state
can be analogously given as
.B rs
and
.BR if .
These strings are output by the
.I reset\^
program, which is used when the terminal gets into a wedged state.
.RI ( Terminfo\^
uses
.B r1-r3
instead of
.BR rs .)
Commands are normally placed in
.B rs
and
.B rf
only if they produce annoying effects on the screen and are not necessary
when logging in.
For example, the command to set the VT100 into 80-column mode
would normally be part of
.BR is ,
but it causes an annoying glitch of the screen and is not normally needed
since the terminal is usually already in 80-column mode.

If the terminal has hardware tabs,
the command to advance to the next tab stop can be given as
.B ta
(usually
.BR ^I ).
A \*(lqbacktab\*(rq command which moves leftward to the previous tab stop

.BR bt .
By convention,
if the terminal driver modes indicate that tab stops are being expanded
by the computer rather than being sent to the terminal,
programs should not use
.B ta
or
.B bt
even if they are present,
since the user may not have the tab stops properly set.
If the terminal has hardware tabs that are initially set every
.I n\^
positions when the terminal is powered up, then the numeric parameter
.B it
is given, showing the number of positions between tab stops.
This is normally used by the
.I tset\^
command to determine whether to set the driver mode for hardware tab
expansion, and whether to set the tab stops.
If the terminal has tab stops that can be saved in nonvolatile memory, the
.I termcap\^
description can assume that they are properly set.
.PP
If there are commands to set and clear tab stops, they can be given as
.B ct
(clear all tab stops) and

Delays embedded in the capabilities
.BR cr ,
.BR sf ,
.BR le ,
.BR ff ,
and
.B ta
will cause the appropriate delay bits to be set in the terminal driver.
If
.B pb

below the value of
.BR pb .
For 4.2BSD

Special strings to go to a position in the status line and to return

This is primarily useful for superscripts and subscripts on hardcopy
terminals.
If a hardcopy terminal can eject to the next page (form feed),
give this as
.B ff
(usually
.BR ^L ).
.PP
If there is a command to repeat a given character a given number of times
(to save time transmitting a large number of identical characters),
this can be indicated with the parameterized string
.BR rp .
The first parameter is the character to be repeated and the second is
the number of times to repeat it.
(This is a
.I terminfo\^
feature that is unlikely to be supported by a program that uses
.IR termcap\^ .)
.PP
If the terminal has a settable command character, such as the
Tektronix 4025, this can be indicated with
.BR CC .
A prototype command character is chosen which is used in all capabilities.
This character is given in the
.B CC
capability to identify it.
The following convention is supported on some UNIX systems:
The environment is to be searched for a
.B
.SM CC
variable,
and if found,
all occurrences of the prototype character are replaced by the character
in the environment variable.
This use of the
.B
.SM CC
environment variable
is a very bad idea, as it conflicts with
.IR make\^ (1).
.PP
Terminal descriptions that do not represent a specific kind of known
terminal, such as
.IR switch\^ ,
.IR dialup\^ ,
.IR patch\^ ,
and
.IR network\^ ,
should include the
.B gn
(generic) capability so that programs can complain that they do not know
how to talk to the terminal.
(This capability does not apply to
.I virtual\^
terminal descriptions for which the escape sequences are known.)
.PP
If the terminal uses xoff/xon (\s-2DC3\s0/\s-2DC1\s0)
handshaking for flow control, give
.BR xo .
Padding information should still be included so that routines can make
better decisions about costs, but actual pad characters will not be
transmitted.
.PP
If the terminal has a \*(lqmeta key\*(rq which acts as a shift key, setting the
8th bit of any character transmitted, then this fact can be indicated with
.BR km .
Otherwise, software will assume that the 8th bit is parity and it will
usually be cleared.
If strings exist to turn this \*(lqmeta mode\*(rq on and off, they can be given as
.B mm
and
.BR mo .
.PP
If the terminal has more lines of memory than will fit on the screen at once,
the number of lines of memory can be indicated with
.BR lm .
An explicit value of 0 indicates that the number of lines is not fixed,
but that there is still more memory than fits on the screen.
.PP
If the terminal is one of those supported by the UNIX system virtual
terminal protocol, the terminal number can be given as
.BR vt .
.PP
Media copy strings which control an auxiliary printer
connected to the terminal can be given as
.BR ps :
print the contents of the screen;
.BR pf :
turn off the printer; and
.BR po :
turn on the printer.
When the printer is on, all text sent to the terminal will be sent to the
printer.
It is undefined whether the text is also displayed on the terminal screen
when the printer is on.
A variation
.B pO
takes one parameter and leaves the printer on for as many characters as the
value of the parameter, then turns the printer off.
The parameter should not exceed 255.
All text, including
.BR pf ,
is transparently passed to the printer while
.B pO
is in effect.
.PP
Strings to program function keys can be given as
.BR pk ,
.BR pl ,
and
.BR px .
Each of these strings takes two parameters: the function key number
to program (from 0 to 9) and the string to program it with.
Function key numbers out of this range may program undefined keys
in a terminal-dependent manner.
The differences among the capabilities are that
.B pk
causes pressing the given key to be the same as the user typing the given
string;
.B pl
causes the string to be executed by the terminal in local mode;
and
.B px
causes the string to be transmitted to the computer.
Unfortunately, due to lack of a definition for string parameters in
.IR termcap\^ ,
only
.I terminfo\^
supports these capabilities.

.B Glitches and Braindamage
.PP
Hazeltine terminals, which do not allow `~' characters to be displayed,
should indicate
.BR hz .
.PP
The
.B nc
capability, now obsolete, formerly indicated Datamedia terminals,
which echo
.B \er \en
for
carriage return then ignore a following linefeed.
.PP
Terminals that ignore a linefeed immediately after an
.B am
wrap, such as the Concept, should indicate
.BR xn .
.PP
If
.B ce
is required to get rid of standout
(instead of merely writing normal text on top of it),
.B xs
should be given.
.PP
E 5
Teleray terminals, where tabs turn all characters moved over to blanks,
D 5
should indicate \fBxt\fR.
Other specific terminal problems may be corrected by adding more
capabilities of the form \fBx\fIx\fR.
E 5
I 5
should indicate
.B xt
(destructive tabs).
This glitch is also taken to mean that it is not possible
to position the cursor on top of a \*(lqmagic cookie\*(rq, and that
to erase standout mode it is necessary to use delete and insert line.
E 5
.PP
D 5
Other capabilities
include \fBis\fR, an initialization string for the terminal,
and \fBif\fR, the name of a file containing long initialization strings.
These strings are expected to properly clear and then set the tabs
on the terminal, if the terminal has settable tabs.
If both are given, \fBis\fR will be printed before \fBif\fR.
This is useful where \fBif\fR is
.I /usr/lib/tabset/std
but \fBis\fR
clears the tabs first.

The Beehive Superbee, which is unable to correctly transmit the
\s-2ESC\s0 or ^C characters, has
.BR xb ,
indicating that the \*(lqf1\*(rq key is used for \s-2ESC\s0 and \*(lqf2\*(rq for ^C.
(Only certain Superbees have this problem, depending on the ROM.)

.B Similar Terminals
.PP
If there are two very similar terminals,
one can be defined as being just like the other with certain exceptions.
D 5
The string capability \fBtc\fR can be given
E 5
I 5
The string capability
.B tc
can be given
E 5
with the name of the similar terminal.
D 5
This capability must be \fIlast\fP and the combined length of the two entries
must not exceed 1024. Since
.I termlib
routines search the entry from left to right, and since the tc capability is
replaced by the corresponding entry, the capabilities given at the left
override the ones in the similar terminal.
D 2
A capability can be cancelled with \fBxx@\fR where xx is the capability.
E 2
I 2
A capability can be canceled with \fBxx@\fR where xx is the capability.
E 5
I 5
This capability must be
.IR last\^ ,
and the combined length of the entries
must not exceed 1024.
The capabilities given before
.B tc
override those in the terminal type invoked by
.BR tc .
A capability can be canceled by placing
.B xx@
to the left of the
.B tc
invocation, where
.I xx\^
is the capability.

D 5
defines a 2621nl that does not have the \fBks\fR or \fBke\fR capabilities,
and hence does not turn on the function key labels when in visual mode.
E 5
I 5
defines a \*(lq2621\-nl\*(rq that does not have the
.B ks
or
.B ke
capabilities,
hence does not turn on the function key labels when in visual mode.
E 5
This is useful for different modes for a terminal, or for different
user preferences.
