.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sgtty.h>
E 2
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes
both a particular special file
.B /dev/tty
and the terminal drivers used for conversational computing.
.LP
.B Line disciplines.
.PP
The system provides different
.I "line disciplines"
for controlling communications lines.
D 9
In this version of the system there are three disciplines available:
E 9
I 9
In this version of the system there are two disciplines available for use
with terminals:
E 9
.IP "old" 8
D 8
The old (standard) terminal driver.  This is used when using the
E 8
I 8
The old (Version 7) terminal driver.  This is sometimes used when using the
E 8
standard shell
D 8
.IR sh (1)
and for compatibility with other standard version 7 UNIX systems.
E 8
I 8
.IR sh (1).
E 8
.IP "new"
D 8
A newer terminal driver, with features for job control; this must
be used when using
E 8
I 8
The standard Berkeley terminal driver, with features for job control;
this must be used when using
E 8
.IR csh (1).
D 2
See
.IR newtty (1)
for a short user-level summary.
E 2
D 8
.IP "net"
A line discipline used for networking and loading data into
the system over communications lines.  It allows high speed input
at very low overhead, and is described in
.IR bk (4).
E 8
.LP
Line discipline switching is accomplished with the TIOCSETD 
D 6
.I ioctl:
E 6
I 6
.IR ioctl :
E 6
.IP
D 6
.B "int ldisc = LDISC; ioctl(filedes, TIOCSETD, &ldisc);"
E 6
I 6
.B "int ldisc = LDISC;"
.br
.B "ioctl(f, TIOCSETD, &ldisc);"
E 6
.LP
D 8
where LDISC is OTTYDISC for the standard tty driver, NTTYDISC for the new
driver and NETLDISC for the networking discipline.
E 8
I 8
where LDISC is OTTYDISC for the standard tty driver
and NTTYDISC for the ``new'' driver.
E 8
The standard (currently old) tty driver is discipline 0 by convention.
I 9
Other disciplines may exist for special purposes, such as use of communications
lines for network connections.
E 9
D 6
The current line discipline can be obtained with the TIOCGETD ioctl.
E 6
I 6
The current line discipline can be obtained with the TIOCGETD
.IR ioctl .
E 6
Pending input is discarded when the line discipline is changed.
.PP
All of the low-speed asynchronous
communications ports can use any
of the available line disciplines, no matter what
hardware is involved.
The remainder of this section discusses the
\*(lqold\*(rq and \*(lqnew\*(rq disciplines.
.LP
.B "The control terminal."
.LP
When a terminal file is opened, it causes the process to wait until a
connection is established.  In practice, user programs seldom open
these files; they are opened by
D 8
.IR init (8)
E 8
I 8
.IR getty (8)
or
.IR rlogind (8C)
E 8
and become a user's standard input and output file.
.PP
If a process which has no control terminal opens a terminal file, then
that terminal file becomes the control terminal for that process.
The control terminal is thereafter inherited by a child process during a
.IR fork (2),
even if the control terminal is closed.
.LP
The file
.B /dev/tty
is, in each process, a synonym for a
.I "control terminal"
associated with that process.  It is useful for programs that wish to
be sure of writing messages on the terminal
no matter how output has been redirected.
It can also be used for programs that demand a file name
for output, when typed output is desired
and it is tiresome to find out which terminal
is currently in use.
.LP
I 6
A process can remove the association it has with its controlling
terminal by opening the file
.B /dev/tty
D 8
and issuing a
E 8
I 8
and issuing an
E 8
.IP
.B "ioctl(f, TIOCNOTTY, 0);"
.LP
This is often desirable in server processes.
.LP
E 6
.B "Process groups."
.LP
D 2
As described more completely in
.IR jobs (3),
command processors such as
E 2
I 2
Command processors such as
E 2
.IR csh (1)
can arbitrate the terminal between different
.I jobs
by placing related jobs in a single process group and associating this
D 6
process group with the terminal.  A terminals associated process group
E 6
I 6
process group with the terminal.  A terminal's associated process group
E 6
may be set using the TIOCSPGRP
.IR ioctl (2):
.IP
D 6
\fBioctl(fildes, TIOCSPGRP, &pgrp)\fR
E 6
I 6
.B "ioctl(fildes, TIOCSPGRP, &pgrp);"
E 6
.LP
D 6
or examined using TIOCGPGRP rather than TIOCSPGRP, returning the current
E 6
I 6
or examined using TIOCGPGRP, which returns the current
E 6
process group in
D 6
.I pgrp.
E 6
I 6
.IR pgrp .
E 6
The new terminal driver aids in this arbitration by restricting access
to the terminal by processes which are not in the current process group;
see
.B "Job access control"
below.
.LP
.B "Modes."
.PP
The terminal drivers have three major modes, characterized by the
amount of processing on the input and output characters:
.IP cooked 10
The normal mode.  In this mode lines of input are collected and input editing
is done.  The edited line is made available when it is completed by
D 8
a newline
D 6
or when an EOT (control-D, hereafter ^D)
E 6
I 6
or when the \fIt_brkc\fP character, normally an EOT (control-D, hereafter ^D),
E 8
I 8
a newline,
or when the \fIt_brkc\fP character (normally undefined)
or \fIt_eofc\fP character (normally an EOT, control-D, hereafter ^D)
E 8
E 6
is entered.
A carriage return is usually made synonymous with newline in this mode,
and replaced with a newline whenever it is typed.
All driver functions
(input editing, interrupt generation,
output processing such as delay generation and tab expansion, etc.)
are available in this mode.
.IP CBREAK 10
This mode eliminates the character, word, and line editing input facilities,
making the input character available to the user program as it is typed.
Flow control, literal-next and interrupt processing are still done in this mode.
Output processing is done.
.IP RAW 10
This mode eliminates all input processing and makes all input characters
available as they are typed; no output processing is done either.
.PP
D 2
The style of input processing can also be very different when,
in the new terminal driver, a process asks for notification
via a SIGTTIN
.IR signal (2)
when input is ready to be read from the control terminal.  In this case a
E 2
I 2
The style of input processing can also be very different when
D 8
the terminal is put in non-blocking i/o mode; see
I 6
the FNDELAY flag as described in
E 8
I 8
the terminal is put in non-blocking I/O mode; see
the FNDELAY flag described in
E 8
E 6
.IR fcntl (2).
In this case a
E 2
.IR read (2)
from the control terminal will never block, but rather
D 2
return an error indication (EIO) if there is no input available.
E 2
I 2
return an error indication (EWOULDBLOCK) if there is no
input available.
.PP
D 9
A process may also request a SIGIO signal be sent it whenever input
is present.  To enable this mode the FASYNC flag should be set using
E 9
I 9
A process may also request that a SIGIO signal be sent it whenever input
is present and also whenever output queues fall below the low-water mark.
To enable this mode the FASYNC flag should be set using
E 9
.IR fcntl (2).
E 2
.LP
.B "Input editing."
.LP
A UNIX terminal ordinarily operates in full-duplex mode.
Characters may be typed at any time,
even while output is occurring, and are only lost when the
system's character input buffers become completely
choked, which is rare,
or when the user has accumulated the maximum allowed number of
input characters that have not yet been read by some program.
Currently this limit is 256 characters.
D 6
In the old terminal driver all the saved characters are thrown away
when the limit is reached, without notice; the new driver simply refuses
to accept any further input, and rings the terminal bell.
E 6
I 6
In RAW mode, the terminal driver
throws away all input and output without notice when the limit is reached.
In CBREAK or cooked mode it refuses to accept any further input and,
if in the new line discipline, rings the terminal bell.
E 6
.PP
Input characters are normally accepted in either even or odd parity
with the parity bit being stripped off before the character is given to
the program.  By clearing either the EVEN or ODD bit in the flags word
it is possible to have input characters with that parity discarded (see the
\fBSummary\fR below.)
I 10
There is also a mode to support 8-bit terminals, see below.
E 10
.PP
In all of the line disciplines, it is possible to simulate terminal
D 6
input using the TIOCSTI ioctl, which takes, as its third argument,
E 6
I 6
input using the TIOCSTI
.IR ioctl ,
which takes, as its third argument,
E 6
the address of a character.  The system pretends that this character
was typed on the argument terminal, which must be the control terminal except
D 2
for the super-user (this call is not in standard version 7 UNIX)..
E 2
I 2
for the super-user (this call is not in standard version 7 UNIX).
E 2
.PP
Input characters are normally echoed by putting them in an output queue
as they arrive.  This may be disabled by clearing the ECHO bit in the
flags word using the
D 2
.IR stty (2)
E 2
I 2
D 6
.IR stty (3)
E 2
call or the TIOCSETN or TIOCSETP ioctls
E 6
I 6
.IR stty (3C)
call or the TIOCSETN or TIOCSETP
.IR ioctl s
E 6
(see the \fBSummary\fR below).
.PP
In cooked mode, terminal input is processed in units of lines.
A program attempting
to read will normally be suspended until an entire line has been
received
D 4
(but see the description of SIGTTIN in \fBModes\fR above and FIONREAD in
\fBSummary\fR below.)
E 4
I 4
(but see the description of SIGTTIN in \fBJob access control\fR
and of FIONREAD in
\fBSummary\fR, both below.)
E 4
No matter how many characters are requested
in the read call, at most one line will be returned.
It is not, however, necessary to read a whole line at
once; any number of characters may be
requested in a read, even one, without losing information.
.PP
D 6
During input, line editing is normally done, with the character `#'
logically erasing the last character typed and the character `@'
E 6
I 6
D 8
During input, line editing is normally done, with the DELETE character
logically erasing the last character typed and the character ^U (control-U)
E 8
I 8
During input, line editing is normally done, with the erase character
.I sg_erase
(by default, DELETE)
logically erasing the last character typed and the
.I sg_kill
character (default, ^U: control-U)
E 8
E 6
logically erasing the entire current input line.
D 6
These are often reset on crt's,
with ^H replacing #,
and ^U replacing @.
E 6
These characters
D 8
never erase beyond the beginning of the current input line or an ^D.
E 8
I 8
never erase beyond the beginning of the current input line or an eof.
E 8
These characters may be entered literally by
D 6
preceding them with `\e\|'; in the old teletype driver both the `\e\|' and
the character entered literally will appear on the screen; in the new
driver the `\e\|' will normally disappear.
E 6
I 6
preceding them with `\e\|'; the `\e\|' will normally be erased when the
character is typed.
E 6
.PP
The drivers normally treat either a carriage return or a newline character
as terminating an input line, replacing the return with a newline and echoing
a return and a line feed.
If the CRMOD bit is cleared in the local mode word then the processing
for carriage return is disabled, and it is simply echoed as a return,
and does not terminate cooked mode input.
.PP
D 8
In the new driver there is a literal-next character ^V which can be typed
E 8
I 8
In the new driver there is a literal-next character (normally ^V)
which can be typed
E 8
in both cooked and CBREAK mode preceding
D 6
.B any
E 6
I 6
.I any
E 6
D 8
character to prevent its special meaning.  This is to be preferred to the
E 8
I 8
character to prevent its special meaning to the terminal handler.
This is to be preferred to the
E 8
D 6
use of `\e\|' escaping erase and kill characters, but `\e\|' is (at least
temporarily) retained with its old function in the new driver for historical
reasons.
E 6
I 6
use of `\e\|' escaping erase and kill characters, but `\e\|' is
retained with its old function in the new line discipline.
E 6
.PP
The new terminal driver also provides two other editing characters in
normal mode.  The word-erase character, normally ^W, erases the preceding
word, but not any spaces before it.  For the purposes of ^W, a word
is defined as a sequence of non-blank characters, with tabs counted as
blanks.
Finally, the reprint character, normally ^R, retypes the pending input beginning
D 2
on a new line.  Retyping occurs automagically in cooked mode if characters
E 2
I 2
on a new line.  Retyping occurs automatically in cooked mode if characters
E 2
which would normally be erased from the screen are fouled by program output.
.LP
.B "Input echoing and redisplay"
.LP
D 6
In the old terminal driver, nothing special occurs when an erase character
is typed; the erase character is simply echoed.  When a kill character
is typed it is echoed followed by a new-line (even if the character is
not killing the line, because it was preceded by a `\e\|'!.)
.PP
The new terminal driver has several modes for handling the echoing of
E 6
I 6
The terminal driver has several modes (not present in standard UNIX
Version 7 systems) for handling the echoing of
E 6
terminal input, controlled by bits in a local mode word.
.LP
.I "Hardcopy terminals."
When a hardcopy terminal is in use, the LPRTERA bit is normally set in
the local mode word.  Characters which are logically erased are
then printed out backwards preceded by `\e\|' and followed by `/' in this mode.
.LP
D 6
.I "Crt terminals."
When a crt terminal is in use, the LCRTBS bit is normally set in the local
E 6
I 6
.I "CRT terminals."
When a CRT terminal is in use, the LCRTBS bit is normally set in the local
E 6
mode word.  The terminal driver then echoes the proper number of erase
characters when input is erased; in the normal case where the erase
character is a ^H this causes the cursor of the terminal to back up
to where it was before the logically erased character was typed.
If the input has become fouled due to interspersed asynchronous output,
D 2
the input is automagically retyped.
E 2
I 2
the input is automatically retyped.
E 2
.LP
D 6
.I "Erasing characters from a crt."
When a crt terminal is in use, the LCRTERA bit may be set to cause
E 6
I 6
.I "Erasing characters from a CRT."
When a CRT terminal is in use, the LCRTERA bit may be set to cause
E 6
input to be erased from the screen with a \*(lqbackspace-space-backspace\*(rq
sequence when character or word deleting sequences are used.
A LCRTKIL bit may be set as well, causing the input to
be erased in this manner on line kill sequences as well.
.LP
.I "Echoing of control characters."
If the LCTLECH bit is set in the local state word, then non-printing (control)
characters are normally echoed as ^X (for some X)
rather than being echoed unmodified; delete is echoed as ^?.
.LP
D 6
The normal modes for using the new terminal driver on crt terminals
are speed dependent.
E 6
I 6
The normal modes for use on CRT terminals are speed dependent.
E 6
At speeds less than 1200 baud, the LCRTERA and LCRTKILL processing
D 8
is painfully slow, so 
E 8
I 8
is painfully slow, and
E 8
.IR stty (1)
normally just sets LCRTBS and LCTLECH; at
speeds of 1200 baud or greater all of these bits are normally set.
.IR Stty (1)
summarizes these option settings and the use of the new terminal
driver as
\*(lqnewcrt.\*(rq
.LP
.B "Output processing."
.PP
When one or more
characters are written, they are actually transmitted
to the terminal as soon as previously-written characters
have finished typing.
(As noted above, input characters are normally 
echoed by putting them in the output queue
as they arrive.)
When a process produces characters more rapidly than they can be typed,
it will be suspended when its output queue exceeds some limit.
When the queue has drained down to some threshold
the program is resumed.
Even parity is normally generated on output.
The EOT character is not transmitted in cooked mode to prevent terminals
D 6
that respond to it from hanging up; programs using raw or cbreak mode
E 6
I 6
that respond to it from hanging up; programs using RAW or CBREAK mode
E 6
should be careful.
.PP
The terminal drivers provide necessary processing for cooked and CBREAK mode
output including delay generation for certain special characters and parity
generation.   Delays are available after backspaces ^H, form feeds ^L,
carriage returns ^M, tabs ^I and newlines ^J.  The driver will also optionally
expand tabs into spaces, where the tab stops are assumed to be set every
D 6
eight columns.  These functions are controlled by bits in the tty flags word;
see \fBSummary\fR below.
E 6
I 6
eight columns, and optionally convert newlines to carriage returns
followed by newline.  These functions are controlled by bits in the tty
flags word; see \fBSummary\fR below.
E 6
.PP
The terminal drivers provide for mapping between upper and lower case
on terminals lacking lower case, and for other special processing on
deficient terminals.
.PP
Finally, in the new terminal driver, there is a output flush character,
normally ^O, which sets the LFLUSHO bit in the local mode word, causing
subsequent output to be flushed until it is cleared by a program or more
input is typed.  This character has effect in both cooked and CBREAK modes
and causes pending input to be retyped if there is any pending input.
D 2
Ioctls to flush the characters in the input and output queues TIOCFLUSH,
and to return the number of character still in the output queue
TIOCOUTQ are also available.
E 2
I 2
D 6
An ioctl to flush the characters in the input and output queues TIOCFLUSH,
E 6
I 6
An
.I ioctl
to flush the characters in the input or output queues, TIOCFLUSH,
E 6
is also available.
E 2
.LP
I 10
.B "8-bit terminals"
.PP
The original Version 7 UNIX tty driver was written with the assumption
that all terminals transmit and expect back only 7-bit characters plus parity.
Now, however, the international community has developed and adopted several
8-bit character sets, such as Soviet KOI-8 and the popular ISO 8859 8-bit
character sets.
Fully 8-bit terminals such as DEC VT2xx and VT3xx series are available
which in their native modes treat the high bit not as parity but as one more
data bit.
.PP
4.3BSD-Quasijarus tty driver provides a mode, enabled by LPASS8 bit in the
local mode word, for interfacing 8-bit terminals with 8-bit character sets.
All input and output processing features available for 7-bit characters in the
old tty driver are available for 8-bit characters when LPASS8 mode is enabled.
The LPASS8 mode reconfigures the underlying hardware interface for 8-bit
no parity mode.
(LPASS8 mode first appeared in 4.3BSD, but was only half-implemented, as
it only affected input while output characters were still stripped to 7 bits.
Full 8-bit terminal support is only available in 4.3BSD-Quasijarus.)
.PP
8-bit terminal support assumes that the 8-bit character set is structured
according to ISO standards, i.e., it is assumed to consist of
C0 (low control), GL (low printable), C1 (high control) and GR (high printable)
sets, with C0 and GL being ASCII.
A 96-character GR set is assumed, i.e., 0377 (0xFF) is treated as printable.
KOI8-E and all ISO 8859 character sets have 96-character GR halves.
.LP
.B "Soviet KOI support"
.PP
4.3BSD-Quasijarus tty driver supports Soviet KOI-7 and KOI-8 terminals,
described in
.IR koi (7).
KOI-7 terminal support is enabled when LKOI bit is set and LPASS8 bit is
cleared in the local mode word (see below).
KOI-8 terminal support is enabled when both LKOI and LPASS8 bits are set in
the local mode word.
The tty driver hides the differences between KOI-7 and KOI-8 terminals
and presents a consistent interface to programs.
Terminal input is always presented to programs in KOI-8, and
output is accepted in both KOI-7 and KOI-8 with automatic conversions
as necessary.
.PP
KOI-8 mode is the same as regular LPASS8 mode except for additional output
processing to catch KOI-7 output and convert it to KOI-8.
To prevent the KOI-7 to KOI-8 output conversion state machine from getting
stuck in the state where it converts ASCII characters to Russian letters, it
is automatically reset whenever a line kill or line reprint function is
performed, or whenever any input is echoed.
.PP
KOI-7 mode processing is more involved.
In KOI-7 mode the underlying hardware interface is configured for 7 bits
with even or odd parity, but user programs reading from the tty
are presented with 8-bit data just like in LPASS8 mode.
SO (016) and SI (017) characters on input cause the tty driver to switch
to RUS or LAT mode, respectively, in both cooked and CBREAK modes.
These characters are also echoed back to the terminal, even if echo is
otherwise disabled, as KOI-7 terminals may need these characters echoed
in order to switch between RUS and LAT modes correctly, and this allows
the operator to recover the terminal after it has been left in the wrong state.
Input characters between 0100 and 0176 octal, inclusive, are then
converted to KOI-8 according to the state of the RUS/LAT switch.
.PP
Note that 0177 octal on input is
.I not
automatically converted to capital hard sign.
This is done so that the delete key remains available for character erase
function, for keyboards on which no other key is conveniently available for
this function.
To enter capital hard sign, press ^V and then the key that generates
the 0177 character.
It will be echoed as ^? since many KOI-7 terminals cannot display the
capital hard sign, in particular, terminals wishing to be compliant with
ISO standards must treat 0177 as the delete control character rather than
capital hard sign when the ISO 5427 character set (ISO-registered version
of the KOI-7 Russian character set) is active, since it is registered as a
94-character set.

Output is stripped to 7 bits in KOI-7 mode, but it is first checked
for KOI-8 Russian characters, and if they are detected, SI and SO control
characters are automatically inserted.

In order to accommodate terminals and workstations with variable-sized
windows, the terminal driver provides a mechanism for obtaining and setting
the current terminal size.
The driver does not use this information internally, but only stores it
and provides a uniform access mechanism.
When the size is changed, a SIGWINCH signal is sent to the terminal's process
group so that knowledgeable programs may detect size changes.
This facility was added in 4.3BSD and is not available in earlier

The `stop' and `start' characters may be the same,
to produce a toggle effect.
It is probably counterproductive to make
other special characters (including erase and kill)
identical.

.SH BUGS
Prior to introduction of 8-bit terminal support the tty driver
has been using the high bit of characters internally for its own purposes.
This internal tinkering with the high bit is still there and can sometimes
interfere with 8-bit terminal support.
All output delays must be turned off when using LPASS8 mode.  Delays
are represented by 8-bit characters in the output queue, and will produce
garbage characters on output instead of delays in LPASS8 mode.
On input the literal-next function sets the high bit.
