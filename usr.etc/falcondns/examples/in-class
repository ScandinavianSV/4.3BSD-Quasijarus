# This file, called a class definition file, tells FalconDNS
# what services it should provide for the standard IN class.
# You can list zones for which your name server should be
# authoritative, and/or enable full-service resolver (FSR)
# functionality by providing a pointer to the root name servers.

# List your zones like this:
zone	example.com		example-com.zone.bin
zone	example.org		example-org.zone.bin
#
# The UNIX filename listed after the domain name for each zone
# is the name of the BINARY zone file in the format invented for
# FalconDNS, *not* the standard ASCII text zone file.  These binary
# zone files are created by zonecomp which compiles them from
# standard RFC 1035 master files, or by zonexfer which pulls a zone
# from another name server via AXFR.  They can be disassembled
# back into text form with zonedump.
#
# The convention adopted by the author is to name RFC 1035 master files
# ending in .zone; the zonecomp utility adds the .bin suffix to its
# binary output by default, producing the example zone file names
# seen above.

# fake zones needed for the localhost kludge
zone	localhost.			localhost.zone.bin
zone	127.IN-ADDR.ARPA		localrev.zone.bin

# Location of the standard root name servers:
NS-anchor . root.anchor

# The NS-anchor mechanism isn't limited to just the root of the domain
# tree: you can install an NS-anchor at any domain node, telling your
# FalconDNS to go to the specified set of servers for all domain names
# falling under that node, accepting both answers and referrals from
# those servers.  Thus you can anchor your resolving servers to your
# authoritative ones, or to those of your friends, ensuring that your own
# local names or those of your friends will continue to resolve even
# if your external Internet connection goes down or the delegation of
# the domain(s) in question from the root/TLD servers gets compromised.
#
# Example:
#
NS-anchor	Harhan.ORG	harhan.anchor
NS-anchor	Harhan.COM	harhan.anchor
NS-anchor	IFCTF.ORG	harhan.anchor
#
# Because an NS-anchor definition file like root.anchor or harhan.anchor
# lists the hostnames of name servers and their IP addresses, but not
# what domain(s) they are authoritative for, one can use the same
# definition file for multiple anchors like the above example shows.
