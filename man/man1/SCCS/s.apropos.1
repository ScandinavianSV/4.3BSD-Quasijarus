keywords in their title.
Each word is considered separately and case of letters is ignored.

Words which are part of other words are considered thus looking for
compile will hit all instances of `compiler' also.

\fIApropos\fP shows which manual pages contain instances of any of the given
\fIkeyword\fP(s) in their title line.  Each word is considered separately
and case of letters is ignored.  Words which are part of other words are
considered; when looking for compile, \fIapropos\fP will also find all
instances of ``compiler''.

If the line output by \fIapropos\fP starts ``name(section) ...'' you can
enter ``man section name'' to get its documentation.
I 8
Try `apropos format' and then `man 3s printf' to get the manual
on the subroutine
.I printf.

If the line starts `name(section) ...' you can do
`man section name' to get the documentation for it.
Try `apropos format' and then `man 3s printf' to get the manual

Normally \fIapropos\fP checks in a standard location (/usr/man) for its
database ``whatis''.  This can be changed by supplying a \fIpath\fP (a
la the Bourne shell) with the \fB-M\fP flag.  This search path must be
a colon (``:'') separated list of directories which \fIapropos\fP will
search for files named ``whatis''.  The path can also be set with the
environmental variable \fIMANPATH\fP.
