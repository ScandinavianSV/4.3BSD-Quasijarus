.sh SYNOPSIS

.if n .ul 0
SID
name
.DT
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Chghist
changes the history information, for the delta specified by the SID, of each
named SCCS file.
.s1
If a directory is named,
.it chghist
behaves as though each file in the directory were
specified as a named file,
except that non-SCCS files
(last component of the pathname does not begin with ``s\fB.\fP''),
and unreadable files,
are silently ignored.
If a name of ``\(em'' is given, the standard input is read;
each line of the standard input is taken to be the name of an SCCS file
to be processed.
Again, non-SCCS files, and unreadable files, are silently ignored.
.s3
The exact permissions necessary to change the history entry of a delta
are documented in the
.it "SCCS/PWB User's Manual."
Simply stated,
they are either (1)
if you made a delta, you can change its history entry;
or (2)
if you own the file and directory you can change a history entry.
.s1
The new history is read from the standard input.
If the standard input is a terminal,
the program will prompt with
``MRs? '' (only if the file has a
.bd v
flag, see
.it admin\c
(1))
and with
``comments? ''.
If the standard input is not a terminal,
no prompt(s) is (are) printed.
A newline preceded by a ``\\'' is read as
a blank, and may be used to make
the entering of the history more convenient.
The first newline not preceded by a ``\\'' terminates
the response for the corresponding prompt.
.s1
When the history entry of
a delta table record (see
.it prt\c
(1))
is changed, all old MR entries (if any) are converted to comments, and
both these and the original comments are preceded by a comment line
that indicates who made the change and when it was made. The new
information is entered preceding the old.
No other changes are made to the delta table entry.
