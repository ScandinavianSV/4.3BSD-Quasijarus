Creating a Makefile
E 3
I 3
The following list describes the files in this directory:
E 3

D 3
You may have to create a new makefile.  There are only two
basic types: for a v6 system & for a v7 system.  All pathnames &
system dependent stuff should be in conf.c.  The makefile distributed
is for our ARPAVAX site, and should work for you.  You may want to
change some of the compile flags as listed in the makefile; these
control things like logging, hashed alias tables, and debugging
info.  We distribute makefile.m4 which can be turned into a makefile;
it may be easier in the long run to modify this file.

Creating a Configuration Table

The configuration table describes the mail world to sendmail.  This
table is quite complex, but in general the table from Berkeley can
be modified to work.  We use an m4 file to specify configuration for
multiple machines; the file whoami.m4 can probably be modified to
set the correct parameters for cf.m4 to generate a sendmail.cf.

Whoami.m4 defines or may define the following macros:

WHOAMI		From /usr/include/whoami, this drives the entire
		configuration.
BNHOST		If defined, the name of this host on BerkNet.
UNHOST		If defined, the name of this host on UUCPnet.
ANHOST		If defined, the name of this host on ArpaNet.
ENHOST		If defined, the name of this host on EtherNet.
m4_SCCS		If defined, we have the SCCS files here.
m4_VAX		If defined, this is a VAX.
m4_VFORK	If defined, we should use the VFORK syscall.
m4_DBMLIB	If defined, we have the DBM version of the alias
		file.

You should really read sendmail.doc before trying anything with
sendmail.  You can run this off using:
	nroff -me sendmail.doc
Among other things, this describes how to build a configuration file.

Creating Pseudo-Users.

Sometimes (particularly in Arpa-land) mail comes from a person who
doesn't really exist.  Some mail will be returned to them from a
pseudo-user named MAILER-DAEMON, which will of course be returned.
But MAILER-DAEMON does not exist, so it is returned.... and you have
a loop.  To break this, every site should have the entry:
	MAILER-DAEMON:root
in their aliases file.

Actual Installation

You will have to do the following things as root:

Put the new sysexits.h in /usr/include.  This defines some other
exit codes used by sendmail.  This is not dangerous unless you
have extended sysexits yourself.

Create the following files:
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root    5161 Jan 10 17:47 /usr/lib/aliases
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root    4096 Jan 10 17:47 /usr/lib/aliases.dir
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root   37888 Jan 10 17:47 /usr/lib/aliases.pag
drwxr-xr-x 2 eric      64 Nov  8 12:56 /usr/lib/mailers
-rwxr-xr-x 1 eric   63162 Jan  5 10:01 /usr/lib/sendmail
-rw-r--r-- 1 eric    3484 Jan  1 18:42 /usr/lib/sendmail.cf
-rw-r--r-- 1 eric     708 Nov  7 15:34 /usr/lib/sendmail.hf
-rw-rw-rw- 1 eric     168 Jan 10 19:11 /usr/lib/sendmail.st
drwxrwxrwx 2 eric     176 Jan 10 19:11 /usr/spool/mqueue

/usr/spool/mqueue may be some less permissive mode if sendmail
runs setuid to the owner (root is recommended, as sendmail will
then do certain file ownerships correctly).  Likewise, the
alias files need not be mode 666 unless you want users to be
able to update the alias file directly.  /usr/lib/sendmail.st
stores statistics and may be safely removed.

DESCRIPTION OF FILES

I 2
AUX		A directory of "other stuff" (which may or may
		not be interesting).  This stuff is UNSUPPORTED
		and given only for examples sake.  Many of these
		programs have not run in some time and may not
		even have reasonable sendmail calling conventions.
AUX/arpa.c	An old (v6 NCP) queueing program, formerly called
		by sendmail on an ARPANET gateway.
AUX/mail-dm.c	An old (v6 NCP) incoming FTP mail server module,
		which called sendmail one time long ago.
E 2

I 3
arpadate.c	A subroutine which creates ARPANET standard dates.
E 3
E 2
D 6
bmove.c		A core-to-core move.  This is in a separate file

		file.  It also does a certain amount of parsing of
		the header, etc.
conf.c		The configuration file.  This contains information
		that is presumed to be quite static and non-

		reasons.  Most of the configuration is in sendmail.cf.

		contains some miscellaneous routines.
D 3
makefile	The makefile used here; this is created from
		makefile.m4.

readcf.c	The routine that reads the configuration file and
		translates it to internal form.
D 3
rmail.c		A program to replace /bin/rmail that reads those
		ugly UUCP header lines and replaces them by a real
		From line with a real address.

recipient.c	Routines that manipulate the recipient list.
E 3
savemail.c	Routines which save the letter on processing errors.

		a handful of other programs use.
useful.h	A header file containing a few things that appear to
		be useful for even the most various programs.
userdbm.h	A header file for the -ldbm stuff.  This should be
		in /usr/include.
E 3

		to people saying "I am on vacation."
E 3
D 2
vax-mail.c	Local mailer under VM/UNIX (similar for V7).  This
		is also included as an example.  This is more complex
		than v6-mail.c because it has to be able to deal with
		UUCP mail also.  Beware of local hacks that will not
		apply to your installation.
E 2
version.c	A master file for Version.c -- it may not exist in
		your distribution.
D 3
whoami.m4	An m4 file describing who we are.  This is driven by

		single word giving your system name.

CHANGES TO OTHER PROGRAMS

You will have to change your equivalent of /bin/mail to take a
"-d" flag.  If this flag is not asserted, /bin/mail should just
turn itself into /usr/lib/sendmail (this is probably in a routine
called "bulkmail" or "sendmail").  The code looks like something
like:

# ifdef SENDMAIL
	{search argv for a -d flag}
	if (!dflag)
	{
		argv[0] = "-sendmail";
		argv[argc] = 0;
		execv(SENDMAIL, argv);
		perror(SENDMAIL);
	}
	{ignore -d flag in further processing}
# endif

This is actually somewhat oversimplified.  See the example mailers
for something more realistic.  Besides the mailers in this directory,
see ../berknet/v6mail.c.

Argv[0] should begin with a "-" to indicate that it is being called
from /bin/mail.  [This is currently unused, but I have tentative
plans... isn't it easier to do it now?]

If you are running server FTP on arpanet, you will have to change
the incoming mail routine to accept mail for any address (rather than
checking to see that the user exists).  Instead of writing the
mail in some non-standard mailbox, pipe the mail to /usr/lib/sendmail
instead (include the -a flag).  Sendmail will give the "350 Enter
Mail" message, etc.  Our "mail-dm.c" is given as an example.

MISCELLANEOUS

This version of sendmail can really truly run as root if you want
it to.  It does some neat stuff if you do, but it is not necessary.
