/* 
 * gigi requires knowing the anlge of arc.  To do this, the triangle formula
 *	c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2*a*b*cos(angle)
 * is used where "a" and "b" are the radius of the circle and "c" is the
 * distance between the beginning point and the end point.
 *
 * This gives us "angle" or angle - 180.  To find out which, draw a line from
 * beg to center.  This splits the plane in half.  All points on one side of the
 * plane will have the same sign when plugged into the equation for the line.
 * Pick a point on the "right side" of the line (see program below).  If "end"
 * has the same sign as this point does, then they are both on the same side
 * of the line and so angle is < 180.  Otherwise, angle > 180.
