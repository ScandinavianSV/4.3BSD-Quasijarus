Quasijarus Consortium has no interest in Jove, does not approve of it,
and will not support it.  It continues to be provided with our BSD releases
only because of the USD:17 document.  The same version that shipped with
4.3BSD is included (static and unmaintained) ostensibly for the benefit
of users who have read the wildly popular Usenix 4.3BSD manuals and want
to use Jove as described in USD:17.
