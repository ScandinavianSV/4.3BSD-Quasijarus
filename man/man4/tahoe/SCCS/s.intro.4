.SH NAME
intro \- introduction to special files and hardware support
.SH DESCRIPTION
This section describes the special files, related driver functions,
and networking support
available in the system.
In this part of the manual, the SYNOPSIS section of
each configurable device gives a sample specification
for use in constructing a system description for the
.IR config (8)
program.
The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages which may appear on the console
and in the system error log
.I /usr/adm/messages
due to errors in device operation.
.PP
This section contains both devices
which may be configured into the system, ``4'' entries,
and network related information,
``4N'', ``4P'', and ``4F'' entries;
The networking support is introduced in
.IR intro (4N).
.PP
A hardware device is identified to the system at configuration time
and the appropriate device or network interface driver is then compiled
into the system.  When the resultant system is booted, the
autoconfiguration facilities in the system probe for the device

support for it.  If a VERSABUS device does not respond at autoconfiguration

on the VERSAbus and, if found, enable the software
support for it.  If a VERSAbus device does not respond at autoconfiguration

enable a VERSABUS device which did not autoconfigure, the system will have to

I 2
enable a VERSAbus device which did not autoconfigure, the system will have to

be rebooted.
.PP
The autoconfiguration system is described in
.IR autoconf (4).

.SH "LIST OF DEVICES"
The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation of
the system.  Devices are indicated by their functional interface.
If second vendor products provide functionally identical interfaces
they should be usable with the supplied software.
(\fBBeware however that we promise the software works
ONLY with the hardware indicated on the appropriate manual page.\fP)
