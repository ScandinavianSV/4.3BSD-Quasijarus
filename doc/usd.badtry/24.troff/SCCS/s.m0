Introduction
.pg
\*(NR and \*(TR are text processors under
D 3
the \s-1PDP\s+1-11 \s-1UNIX\s+1 Time-Sharing System\*u1\*d
E 3
I 3
the \s-1UNIX\s+1 Time-Sharing System
E 3
that format text for typewriter-like terminals and
D 4
for a \%Graphic Systems phototypesetter, respectively.
I 3
(Device-independent \*(TR, part of the Documenter's Workbench,
supports additional output devices.)
E 4
I 4
for typesetters (see below), respectively.
E 4
E 3
They accept lines of text interspersed with lines of
format control information and
format the text into a printable, paginated document
having a user-designed style.
\*(NR and \*(TR offer
unusual freedom in document styling,
including:
arbitrary style headers and footers;
arbitrary style footnotes;
multiple automatic sequence numbering for paragraphs, sections, etc;
multiple column output;
dynamic font and point-size control;
arbitrary horizontal and vertical local motions at any point;
and
a family of automatic overstriking, bracket construction, and
line drawing functions.
.pg
\*(NR and \*(TR are highly compatible with each other and it is almost always
possible to prepare input acceptable to both.
Conditional input is provided that enables
the user to embed input expressly destined for either program.
\*(NR can prepare output directly for a variety of terminal types and
is capable of utilizing the full resolution of each terminal.
.pg
I 4
.tr &&
\*(TR has evolved over the years; several different versions exist for
producing output on different kinds of typesetters, printers, plotters
and other devices that can produce output of traditional typographic quality.
The original \*(TR drove a \%Graphic Systems CAT phototypesetter.
Many post-processors have been written that take \*(TR output and convert
it into other formats suitable for other devices.
In particular, UC Berkeley developed filters and scripts for printing
to Benson-Varian and Versatec printers/plotters with the classic \*(TR.
However, since \*(TR was
designed around the idiosyncrasies of the CAT phototypesetter, such
post-processors serve poorly as a general solution.
In response to the need for a better general solution, two newer versions
of the \*(TR program itself have been developed.
D 5
AT&T developed \*(DI, which stands for Device-independent \*(TR.
E 5
I 5
AT&T developed \*(DI, which stands for device-independent \*(TR.
E 5
\*(DI is designed to support any typesetter or output device as long as
the user provides a description and an output driver for it, but it was
still written when typesetters were highly specialized equipment with
wildly diverse ad hoc interfaces and is designed for that paradigm.
Independent of that development, Michael\ Sokolov developed \*(PS,
a version of \*(TR that is completely independent of any physical hardware
and formats text
into the world standard PostScript page description language.
PostScript is an extremely powerful device-independent page description
language that has reached worldwide acceptance and is supported by today's
most innovative printers, typesetters, film recorders, and computer display
environments.
.pg
\*(NR, \*(TR and \*(PS are included in the 4.3BSD-Quasijarus distribution.
For compatibility with previous Berkeley releases,
\*(TR filters and scripts for Varian and Versatec are also included.
(\*(TR was used at Berkeley with those plotters much more than with the
real CAT phototypesetter.)
This document is formatted with \*(PS and describes all three formatters.

Usage
.pg
The general form of invoking \*(NR (or \*(TR) at \s-1UNIX\s+1 command level is
.x1
\fBnroff  \fIoptions  files\fR\
\h'|2i'(or  \fBtroff  \fIoptions  files\fR)
.x2
where \fIoptions\fR represents any of a number of option arguments
and \fIfiles\fR represents the list of files containing the document
to be formatted.
An argument consisting of a single minus (\fB\-\fR) is taken to be
a file name corresponding to the standard input.
If no file names are given input is taken from the standard input.
The options, which may appear in any order so long as they appear
before the files, are:
